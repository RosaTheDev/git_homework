I haven't been to class yet but I'm excited to start.
I'm learning so much already about to start

I'm going to try working on using the active voice on the subject of my commit
messages
I'm also trying to keep the total characters of the subject and body under 72
characters

I'd like to thank my girl Immija who has supported me through this process and
believes in me

I'd also like to thank Amy Holt for mentoring me and coaching me so I can pass
  the logic portion of the Turing application and get reaccepted into Turing
